        <h2>About the Sanctuary</h2>
        <p>
          Wild Oasis Wolf Sanctuary was founded in 2025 with a simple goal: to provide a permanent, safe home for wolves and wolf-dogs who have been displaced, abused, or abandoned. What started with one enclosure and two rescued wolves has grown into a 20-acre haven, complete with natural habitats, enrichment spaces, and a dedicated care team.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our mission is to ensure that every resident can live out their lives in peace, with proper nutrition, medical care, and the companionship of their own kind. Wild Oasis is more than a refuge, it's a voice for those who cannot speak for themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          The website was created with the goal of informing, inspiring, and engaging visitors who care deeply about wildlife and may want to visit, support, or learn more about our sanctuary. From the start, our intent was to design a user-friendly, visually appealing, and informative platform that reflects the sanctuary’s mission: to protect and care for rescued wolves while educating the public about their importance in the ecosystem.

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Interavtive Wolf Profiles:</strong> Let users click on individual wolves to learn their stories, with video clips, voiceovers, or adopt-a-wolf options.</li><br>
          <li><strong>Online Store:</strong> Sell branded merchandise and support gear to raise funds.</li><br>
          <li><strong>Live Webcam Feeds:</strong> Show live footage of the sanctuary to deepen engagement and transparency.</li><br>
          <li><strong>Donation Tracker</strong> Publicly display progress toward funding goals or ongoing projects.</li><br>
        </ul>
