        <h2>Oracle</h2>
        <p>Oracle was rescued from a roadside attraction where she lived in a small cage. Since arriving at Wild Oasis, she's become one of the most curious and vocal wolves in the pack. She loves lounging in the shade and howling at sunset.</p>

        <h2>Chaos</h2>
        <p>Chaos was found injured and alone in the wild after being separated from his pack. Now healed, he’s a calm and wise presence among the other wolves, often seen watching over them from his favorite hill.</p>
